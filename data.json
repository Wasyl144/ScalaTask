A qubit is a two-state quantum-mechanical system, one of the simplest quantum systems displaying the peculiarity of quantum mechanics. Examples include the spin of the electron in which the two levels can be taken as spin up and spin down; or the polarization of a single photon in which the two states can be taken to be the vertical polarization and the horizontal polarization. In a classical system, a bit would have to be in one state or the other. However, quantum mechanics allows the qubit to be in a coherent superposition of both states simultaneously, a property that is fundamental to quantum mechanics and quantum computing.","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit"},{"article":"<p><b>CES</b> may stand for:</p><ul><li>Closed ecological system, isolated from the outside</li>\n<li>Clean Energy Standards</li>\n<li>Constant elasticity of substitution, in economics, a feature of a particular class of production function</li>\n<li>The ISO 639 code for the Czech language</li></ul>","title":"CES may stand for:Closed ecological system, isolated from the outside\nClean Energy Standards\nConstant elasticity of substitution, in economics, a feature of a particular class of production function\nThe ISO 639 code for the Czech language","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CES"},{"article":"<p><b>Dynamics</b> or <b>dynamic</b> may refer to:</p>","title":"Dynamics or dynamic may refer to:","link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics"},{"article":"<p><b>Problem solving</b> consists of using generic or ad hoc methods in an orderly manner to find solutions to problems.
